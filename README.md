# AzureBlobStorage.StartCopyFromUriAsync
Basic Project to test Azure Blob Storage StartCopyFromUriAsync for the following issue:
https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/37006

All configurations should be done on Program.cs between lines 9 and 17.

On line 27 is where the name URI of the file should be added.
I generated the SAS directly on Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.
